# codecup-flippo

This is my [Monte Carlo tree search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search)-based entry in the [2019 CodeCup competition](https://www.codecup.nl/competition.php?comp=239). It ended up being second of the Dutch National Informatics Olympiad competitors.

[CodeCup](https://www.codecup.nl/) is an organisation that releases programming challenges based on a board game every year. The game of 2019 was Flippo ([rules of the game Flippo](https://www.codecup.nl/flippo/rules.php)). Contenders can submit programs that will compete in a tournament against the programs of other contenders.
